# Wine Quality Classification
This is the code implemented for my master AI project. I wrote three AI models: the Artificial Neural Networks, the K-Nearest Neighbors and the Bayes Classifier. These algorithms are applied to a real world example, which is the classification of the quality of the wine. The dataset was retrieved from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality), and each sample is determined by its physicochemical proprieties and quality value.

# Artificial Neural Network Implementation

Above is the implemented Artificial Neural Network approximating the sine function. This experiment is based on the Universal approximation theorem.
